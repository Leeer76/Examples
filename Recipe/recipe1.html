				<h2>Face Melting Grilled Cheese</h2>
					<img class="float" src="grilled_cheese.jpg" height="200" width="300" alt="Grilled">
				<h3>Ingredients</h3>
					<ul class="space">
						<li>2 slices of 12 grain bread</li>
						<li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
						<li>1 slice of munster cheese</li>
						<li>1 slice of smoked cheddar cheese</li>
						<li>1 whole pickle</li>
						<li>1 1/2 tablespoons of bacon bits</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h3>Directions</h3>
						<ol class="space">
							<li>slice both the munster cheese slice and the whole pickle into 1/3 strips (pickle should be cut the long way).
							pat dry the pickle slices with a paper towel. Now weave the pickle and cheese strips together much like a wicker basket.</li>
							<li>Butter one side of each of the two slices of 12 grain bread. Place one piece of the buttered
							bread butter side down and lay the slice of smoked cheddar on top of un-buttered side. Now sprinkle
							the bacon bits over top of the smoked cheddar. Finally put your woven together chees and pickle combo on top of the bacon bits,
							then place the remaining piece of bread on top of the woven slice un-buttered side down.</li>
							<li>Turn one of the burners on the stove top to medium heat, place a non-stick frying pan on that burner and let it heat for about
							2-3 minutes. Once the frying pan has been heated up place your pre-assembled sandwich into the frying pan (carefully as to not burn yourself).
							Let the butter and heat do its job and cook until golden brown, then carefully flip the sandwich over on the other side (use caution as the cheese
							may have not fully fused together yet) and let it cook until golden brown as well.</li>
							<li>Once both sides are golden brown and the cheese is melted to an acceptable gooiness, remove sandwich from the frying pan onto a plate.
							Cut sandwich in half and enjoy!</li>
